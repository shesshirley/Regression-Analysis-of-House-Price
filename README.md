# Regression-Analysis-of-House-Price

## Abstract
This project focuses on the performance of house price of unit area, based on the transaction
date, house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores, latitude
and longitude. The data can be found from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. We will
figure out if the house price of unit area can be predicted by selected factors. Moreover, we
want to explore which is the most influential predictor on house price among these factors.

## Question of Interest
We consider the following questions:
### Question 1: What factors affect the price of the house most?
### Question 2: What is the best set of factors to predict the price of the house?

## Regression Method
Firstly, we need to construct a model to meet all four LINE conditions to explore further
relationship. We will first use means of residual analysis to figure out most important
predictors in our models with their transformations if needed. Then we can judge which
predictors are suitable for our model to explain the variation of house prices in unit area by
using variable selection procedures.
After finding our best final model, we can answer some related research questions:
### Question 1: Is there an association between House age and house price of unit area?
### Question 2: What price do we expect a house with age 30 and with average values of the other predictors to have?
